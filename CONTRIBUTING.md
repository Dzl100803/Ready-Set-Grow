Hello! We are the Google Developer Student Clubs - PLM Chapter!
We are having our first event for this academic year that is entitled "Ready Set Grow". Ready Set Grow is a week-long series of career and profile-building filled with 
webinars and workshops. The main goal is to gear up students towards their journey in the professional world through the activities prepared that would foster technology 
literacy, global competitiveness and self-empowerment.

Our event needs a website and we need passionate people to work on it. And it's Hacktoberfest, so since you're reading this, I hope you're gonna help us.

Here's the guideline on how you can contribute:

1. Check the "Projects" tab and see the checklist of all the tasks that must be done.
2. Check if there's any issue that you think you can solve.

That's all we need. All of the assets will be provided if you need it in a particular task. Here is the Figma link so you can see what needs to be done.
